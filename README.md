My Worker Class - to make DB actions much simpler if not using frameworks 

Still working on it...

Currently:
- add data to mysql db
- add user data to mysql db
- login function 
- search data from mysql db

Limitations:
- input names should be exactly the same as your field names or you have to create the array using your field names as index
- for login and add user to work, username and password field should be named "username" and "password"

How to use:
- see demo
